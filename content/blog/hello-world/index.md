This is the first entry on this thing.  

Right now I'm figuring out how to deploy this gatsby site in my homelab using GitHub actions and a self hosted runner.

I'm currently in Düsseldorf for my 6th semester.

Rundown of my day:
- Social Media & Web Analytics class
- Jammed out to [Kanye's Church Service in Calabasas](https://youtu.be/REOkiD1y6rA)
- Figured out the best way to organize RSS feeds in this day and age
- Listened to 'My Song' by Labi Siffre
- Configured Nginx Proxy Manager behind Cloudflare in my Proxmox DMZ
- Deployed FreshRSS
- Made sick burgers for dinner

Today was a good day :)  
Do what makes you happy people!
